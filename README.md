# Lock & Meteor sample

This sample project shows how to use [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) with Lock.

## Important

Set your Auth0 account ClientID and Domain in the [settings.json](https://github.com/auth0/meteor-auth0/blob/master/examples/auth0-meteor-sample/settings.json) file. Also, set the callback URL on the settings section of your Auth0 App.

## Running the example

In order to run the example you just need `meteor` installed. Then run:

```bash
meteor --settings settings.json
```

Go to `http://localhost:3000` and you'll see the app running & working :boom:.
